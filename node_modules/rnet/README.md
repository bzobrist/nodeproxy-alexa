# How to install
There is currently only one way to install Rnet: by installing it with npm. You can run:
``` 
npm install rnet
```
to install.

Once installed you need to connected it with your express application. This is an example: 
```javascript
express = require("express");
gen = require("gen");
app = express();
gen.open(app);

app.get("/",(req,res)=>{
  res.end("My awesome application")
});
```
